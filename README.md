This is the NSL (National Species List) Services Application developed at the Australian National Botanic Gardens in
association with CHAH, the ALA and the IBIS team.

The NSL services provide a relatively generic set of services for searching Names, Refererences and Authors as well as
accessing classification trees of taxons.

The NSL is (and probably always will be) a work in progress, we'll be adding a roadmap and more doco here as we go.
